      <p>The purpose of DisposableCalendar is to serve as a throwaway calendar for you and your coworkers. No authorization steps, no sign ups or logins. 
      Simply generate yourself a unique calendar and share the link with your guests. 
      Anyone can add or edit events if they have your calendar link. Easy to share, easy to onboard.

      Security: Though there are CRUD rules in place.
      <br><br>
      Publications: We list the fields in the publication that we want to publish because in the future we may add additional fields to the document and wouldn't want those explicitly published. TODO</p>
